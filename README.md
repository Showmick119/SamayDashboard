# Samay Dashboard
- A tool for forecasting using foundational time-series models like the Large Pre-trained Model (LPTM), Chronos, TimesFM and TimeMOE.
- The dashboard also includes research methodologies and outcomes for the Large Pre-trained Model, as well as detailed descriptions and research paper summarizations for the other foundational models.
- These other foundational models are primarily for benchmarking and performance comparisons with the Large Pre-trained Model.
- The dashboard is sending HTTP requests to a Flask API which is running on a private NVIDIA DGX server and has 4 endpoints for loading model, uploading dataset, finetuning model and running inference.
